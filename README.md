# Zero Shot Learning 

### Method1 : Zero Short Learning with Word2Vector for class labels(label embedding)
Zero shot learning aims to solve a task to identify classes that are not seen by the model during training.
For example, letâ€™s say you have seen a horse but never seen a zebra. If I tell you that a zebra looks like a horse but it has black and white stripes, you will probably immediately recognize a zebra when you see it.
This is what zero-shot learning aims to tackle.

Data has been collected from this website https://visualgenome.org/ 20 classes in total where there are 15 classes selected for training and 5 classes selected as Zero-Shot classes

#### Train Classes:
arm, boy, bread, chicken, child, computer, ear, house, leg, sandwich, television, truck, vehicle, watch, woman
#### Zero-Shot Classes:
car, food, hand, man, neck
