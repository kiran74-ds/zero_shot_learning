# Zero Shot Learning

Zero shot learning aims to solve a task to identify classes that are not seen by the model during training.
For example, letâ€™s say you have seen a horse but never seen a zebra. If I tell you that a zebra looks like a horse but it has black and white stripes, you will probably immediately recognize a zebra when you see it.
This is what zero-shot learning aims to tackle.
